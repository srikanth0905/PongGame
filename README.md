# Pong Game in Python
***
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle module. 
The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle on either side of the screen, 
and trying to hit a ball back and forth between them. The first player to let the ball pass their paddle loses a point, 
and the game continues until you stop to play.

## Installation
To run the Pong game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you also need to install the Turtle module. This module is included in the standard library, so you don't need to install anything else.

### Usage
To start the game, simply run the pong.py file in your Python environment:

### Copy code
```markdown
python main.py
```
The game will open in a new window, and you can use the following keys to control the paddles:

Player 1: "w" to move up, "s" to move down. <br/>
Player 2: Up arrow key to move up, down arrow key to move down.<br/>
The game will continue until one player closes the window.
